      <h2 class="intro-header">Hey!</h2>
      <p class="readable-content">I am Joey. I am 20 years old, born and raised in Willow Street,
          Pennsylvania. I graduated from Lampeter-Strasburg highschool in 2017.
          I am a student at Thaddeus Stevens, currently
          enrolled in the Computer Software Engineering Technologies program.
          Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a software developer.
          I believe my love for technology and computers started when I was
          a young boy. I remember sitting infront of our big clunky Windows
          PC for hours just messing around with anything I could find, and trying
          to figure out how it worked because it was so intriguing to me. I
          still have that same passion and drive for learning about technology
          today.</p>

      <p class="readable-content">Going to Thaddeus Stevens has been an awesome privilege. I've
          never been more excited about going to a class and learning. I'm
          very excited to see where my path after this program leads me.</p>

        use of good selectors. You can find this project
